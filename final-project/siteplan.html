            <h5>Small Business Owner</h5>
            <p>
              Pedro is a 72-year-old shoemaker who has run his small local
              repair shop in Valpara√≠so for over 50 years. His business is known
              for its high-quality work and loyal customer base, all built
              through word of mouth. Although he has heard that promoting his
              services online could bring in more clients, he has no experience
              with digital tools and feels overwhelmed by technology. Pedro
              wants to adapt to the modern world but needs simple, clear
              guidance to get started without changing the essence of his
              traditional craft.

            <p>
              Mar√≠a is a 38-year-old school teacher from Quilpu√© who is
              passionate about finding unique, high-quality furniture. She
              dislikes mass-produced pieces from big retailers like Par√≠s,
              Jumbo, or Falabella, and instead wants to support local artisans.
              However, she doesn‚Äôt know where to find local businesses that
              offer the kind of personalized furniture she‚Äôs looking for. Mar√≠a
              is searching for a platform where she can easily discover and
              connect with local creators who align with her taste and values.

            <h5>Young owner of a small business.</h5>
            <p>
              Benja is a 22-year-old university student at the Universidad
              T√©cnica Federico Santa Mar√≠a. To help pay for his education, he
              runs a small art business where he sells custom paintings,
              caricatures, and realistic drawings. Although talented, Benja
              struggles to reach a broader audience and connect with people
              interested in his work. He is eager to improve his business and
              join a community of young entrepreneurs, but lacks the network and
              knowledge to promote his services effectively online.
